# Laptop Price Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting the prices of laptops using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering, model building.

## Introduction

Laptop Price Prediction aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of laptops based on their features. This project demonstrates the entire workflow from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features of laptops such as:

- RAM
- Weight
- TouchScreen
- IPS
- PPI
- HDD
- SSD
- Brand
- Type
- Operating System
- CPU
- GPU

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Clean the dataset
    - Feature engineering
    - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Train the model:**
    - Split the data into training and test sets
    - Train the model using the training set
    - Evaluate the model using the test set

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    - Use `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning

4. **Prediction:**
    - Use the trained model to predict laptop prices
